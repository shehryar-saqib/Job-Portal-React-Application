# 💼 Job Portal Application

A modern, responsive job portal built with React.js for seamless job discovery, posting, and application tracking. This platform bridges the gap between employers and job seekers by offering a clean, intuitive, and interactive user experience.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike generic job boards, this application prioritizes **user experience**, with a real-time search interface, streamlined posting process, and clear job categorization. It's designed with both **job seekers and recruiters** in mind—each having dedicated workflows and tailored interfaces.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Live Search & Filtering** — Instantly filter jobs by role, level, tools, and location.
- 🧾 **Job Posting Workflow** — Simple form to post a new job with validation.
- 🔐 **Authentication** — Register/login workflows for users.
- 🗂️ **Saved Jobs & My Jobs** — View personal job applications and postings.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Optimized for mobile and desktop.
- 📦 **JSON-Based Mock Backend** — Uses JSON data to simulate real-world data flow.
- 📊 **Reusable Components** — Modular, clean React component architecture.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS/SCSS, JSX
- **Assets & UI:** SVG-based logos and responsive illustrations
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Mock Data:** JSON files simulate API-like responses

## 📁 Project Structure Highlights

- `src/components/` – All major UI building blocks
- `src/images/` – Vector icons and illustrations
- `public/` – Static files and landing content
- `data.json` – Mock job listings and company data
